// ================ Start of tutorial =================

// In this tutorial, we'll look a node arrays, using per-pixel material shading as an example.
// Material shading is commonly used with visibility buffers. A prominent example for this would be Unreal Engine's Nanite.
// The input is a (different) material ID for every pixel and set of shading functions, which calculate the pixel color
// based on the material ID and some other parameters.
// For this tutorial, we use raytracing to render a small scene with three different materials: the sky, a sphere, and a plane.
// You can find the raytracing code and material shading function in "Scene.h".

// Task 0: Start by familiarizing yourself with the existing code.
//         Have a look at the "RenderScene" and see how it is launched from the "Entry" node at the bottom of the file.
//         All of this should be familiar by now - if not, maybe have a look at the previous tutorials again.
// Task 1: Have a look at the data required to shade a pixel (or sample) (e.g., pixel coordinate)
//         Start by declaring a record for shading a single pixel below.
// Task 2: Declare a node for each of the three different materials. See details below.
//         All of these nodes must use the same [NodeLaunch(...)] parameter and use the same input record.
// Task 3: Declare an output to your node array in the "RenderScene" node.
// Task 4: For each thread, create and send a record to your node array with the correct node array index based on the ray tracing result.
//         Fill your record with all the data needed to shade the material.
//
// The resulting graph will then look like this:
//
// +-------+         +-------------+         +------------------------+
// | Entry |-------->| RenderScene |-------->|     ShadePixel[3]      |
// +-------+         +-------------+         |========================|
//                                           | Nodes in NodeArray:    |
//                                           | [0]: ShadePixel_Sky    |
//                                           | [1]: ShadePixel_Sphere |
//                                           | [2]: ShadePixel_Plane  |
//                                           +------------------------+

// [Task 1]: Define your record struct to shade each pixel here.

// [Task 2]: Declare your material shading nodes here, using the record you just defined as an input.
//           Revisit tutorial-2 and choose a fitting node launch mode for shading a pixel.
//           You'll need three different nodes for each of the different materials.
//           Use the [NodeId(...)] attribute to tie all of these nodes together to a single node array.
//           Tipp: You can use [NodeId("...", (uint)RayHit::Material::...)] to use the "Material" enum instead of hard-coded values.
